# Welcome to The Chat app ðŸ‘‹

## Get started

1. The current version of Node I'm using is v22.13.1, so make sure you have that. 
   If you dont have that version, try getting NVM(Node version Manager) 
   because it helps a lot with that. ---> (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

      * Once downloading and installing nvm, you need to run two commands:
       1- nvm install 22.13.1
       2- nvm use 22.13.1

      from now on you will be using my version of node, Good luck!   


2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

4. Start the Convex (the real-time database that we are using)

   ```bash
    npx convex dev
   ```
After that you can enjoy playing with the app in web or your phone using Expo Go, Cheers!
